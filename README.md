# CpZen IDE

CpZen is an online programming problem-solving system. It has a sign-up/log-in feature and uses an API to find programming problems and submit the user's solutions.

We developed this app for our Mobile Development project in the fifth semester. We have implemented it with Flutter and Dart.
